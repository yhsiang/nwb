**Added:**

- Express [middleware](https://github.com/insin/nwb/blob/master/docs/Middleware.md#middleware) for running a React app on your own development server using nwb's Webpack config generation [[#8](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/8)]

**Changed:**

- Webpack loader config objects are now merged with [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge); query objects will now be deep merged, with lists occurring at the same position in build and user config being concatenated instead of overwritten.

**Fixed:**

- babel-runtime can now be resolved from nwb's dependencies when using `optional: ['runtime']` Babel config [[#10](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/10)]
- Paths to resources required from CSS in React app builds [[#9](https://github.com/insin/nwb/issues/9)]
